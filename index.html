								<!-- 128 W 135 H -->
								<img class="playerImage" src="assets/drake_edited.jpg">
								<h3 class="playerName">Drake</h3>
								<h3 class="playerRole">Hype man</h3>
								<p class="playerBio">Drake made this team for one reason, he walks and talks with emotion. Every great team should have someone like that to always keep the morals high, as well as keep heads from hanging.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="person2">
								<img class="playerImage" src="assets/marchand_edited.jpg">
								<h3 class="playerName">Brad Marchand</h3>
								<h3 class="playerRole">Power forward</h3>
								<p class="playerBio">I did not just choose Marchand because he is an icon of my favorite hockey club, I chose him because he does whatever he can to make a play, hes a bit of a smaller guy but has no problem getting down and dirty for his team mates. Marchand shows really great character and that goes a long way on a team.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="person3">
								<img class="playerImage" src="assets/johnny_edited.jpg">
								<h3 class="playerName">Johnny Knoxville</h3>
								<h3 class="playerRole">comedic relief</h3>
								<p class="playerBio">Heres Johnny! Johnny Knoxville has been an American icon for probably some of the stupidest stunts TV has ever seen, but that is what makes him great. After a tough loss or a hard day, Johnny will be there to lift the team back to high spirits.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="person4">
								<img class="playerImage" src="assets/john_edited.jpg">
								<h3 class="playerName">John F. Kennedy</h3>
								<h3 class="playerRole">Point guard</h3>
								<p class="playerBio">John F. Kennedy the point guard, the leader of the offense. President Kennedy is one of my great idols, he really believed in doing right for his country, and wanted to make America the super power it really is. He came from a very bright background and was very inteligent. Every team needs a leader like him, without that kind of back-bone no team can survive.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="person5">
								<img class="playerImage" src="assets/rosa_edited.jpg">
								<h3 class="playerName">Rosa Parks</h3>
								<h3 class="playerRole">Small forward</h3>
								<p class="playerBio">Rosa Parks has been selected to take part on this team because of her drive to fight for what is right. Rosa fights for what she wants and what she believes in, that is a big reason why she is one of my idols. She keeps her head hight and bears any punishment that may be given to prove what is right and wrong.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="person6">
								<img class="playerImage" src="assets/bill_edited.jpg">
								<h3 class="playerName">Bill Gates</h3>
								<h3 class="playerRole">Center</h3>
								<p class="playerBio">My team features Bill Gates as a center becuase of his major contrubution to society today. Bill gates and his collegues were part of one of the greatest technological movments of modern history, allowing us to access any information we need or want at any second of the day, if that doesnt spell out greatness nothing will.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="person7">
								<img class="playerImage" src="assets/moro_edited.jpg">
								<h3 class="playerName">Paul Moro</h3>
								<h3 class="playerRole">Coach</h3>
								<p class="playerBio">Coach Paul Moro is someone who I will always admire. Paul was my football coach for only two years, but in that time I learned so many things other than football, learning to take charge, learning to push myself farther and farther and to never just be satisfied with where I am. He came in to us as just a coach, but left like family. I have chosen him to be our coach not only for his 2nd place spot on Arizona's all time win list with 324 wins and 13 state championships, but because he cares about his players, and wants nothing but the best for them.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="person8">
								<img class="playerImage" src="assets/dad_edited.jpg">
								<h3 class="playerName">Mark Eramian</h3>
								<h3 class="playerRole">Announcer</h3>
								<p class="playerBio">My dad has been choosen to be the teams announcer becuase of his witty attitude and ability to make up word combinations you never thought imaginable, he would for sure be the only announcer to get hired, and probably fired for saying something completly outrageous in the same day.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="person9">
								<img class="playerImage" src="assets/weible_edited.jpg">
								<h3 class="playerName">Mr. Weible</h3>
								<h3 class="playerRole">Assistant coach</h3>
								<p class="playerBio">Mr. Weible is our assistant coach for a lot of the same reasons as Coach Moro, He has shown me to always push forward and never stop going. I have learned a lot from Mr. Weible, how to be proper in the work place, how to properly apply for jobs. The skills I have learned are all real life skills that I will need, and that to me is a true leader.</p>
